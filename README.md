Source code of ModernWeapons bukkit plugin.<br>
Updated to Java 21 and spigot API 1.21<br>

ModernWeapons - The weapon revolution!<br>
ModernWeapons adds weapons to your server such as guns, rocket launchers and grenades. You can fully customize the properties of each weapon in the config.yml! There are also permissions for each weapon, without that a player can't use a weapon. It's great fun to use and play around with it!<br>

Features
* Weapon Types: Assault Rifle, Submachine Gun, Pistol, Sniper, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, Grenade, Knife
* All weapons are fully customizable
* Weapons can play specific sound effects
* Weapons are able to play effects when firing
* You can reload your weapons manually (Shift + Right Click)
* You can scope with weapons (Left Click)
* Grenades can have potion effects
* Customizable weapon, death, headshot and other messages
* Optional headshot blood effects
* You can limit weapons for worlds
* Optional special effects when bullets hit something
* Disable weapons in non pvp areas (requires WorldGuard & WorldEdit)
* Different config files for grenades and guns which don't have to be reloaded
* You can stab other players with the knife from behind

Original project by DarkBlade12. Kudos to him for creating a great little plugin for our Wild Wild West server whilst it was operational.

#Texture Pack
I created a texture pack that can be found [here](https://ob-mc.net/repo/ModernWeaponsTP.zip). Drop it into your resource folder client side.
I think it can be used server side too, but haven't tested that.
